# Resilient Networks Project (Winter Term 2024/2025)

## Overview
Analysis of network resilience using two real-world graphs:
1. ZeroAccess P2P Botnet (GitHub: iBigQ/botnet-graphs)
2. California Road Network (SNAP)

## Objectives
- Compute â‰¥5 network metrics (density, clustering, path length, assortativity, etc.)
- Analyze robustness under random and targeted attacks
- Compare structural differences between a botnet and a road network

## Run
